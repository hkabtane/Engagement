# Engagement
Enhancing user experiences in e-learning environments remains a critical chal- lenge. To address this, we propose a real-time engagement detection system for e-learning, utilizing facial emotion recognition with a fine-tuned VGG-19 model. The system captures learners’ facial expressions and classifies them into seven emotional states, along with other engagement indicators like sleepiness and inat- tention. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves high accuracy (87.09%) in detecting learners’ emotional states and engagement lev- els, with a significant improvement when emotional indicators are weighted, it achieves an accuracy of up to 95.12%. The system addresses the challenge of assessing learner’s engagement based on emotional cues and behaviors, offering real-time feedback to educators to improve learner engagement and enhance the overall e-learning experience.
